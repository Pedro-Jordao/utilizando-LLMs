# Project Instructions

This is a physics-based roulette game project using HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus is on implementing realistic physics for the roulette wheel rotation and ball movement.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use clear and descriptive variable names
- Implement proper physics calculations for realistic animations
- Keep the code modular and well-organized
- Add comments for complex physics calculations
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features when appropriate
- Follow responsive design principles

## Physics Implementation Notes

The physics simulation should account for:
- Angular momentum and rotation
- Gravity effects on the ball
- Friction and air resistance
- Bounce mechanics
- Collision detection
