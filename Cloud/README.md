# Physics-Based Roulette Game

A web-based roulette game that implements physics-based animations for the wheel rotation and ball movement. The game features realistic ball physics with gravity and bounce effects, smooth animations, and an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- Realistic roulette wheel animation with proper physics
- Ball movement with gravity and bounce effects
- Smooth deceleration using friction
- Interactive controls (Spin and Reset buttons)
- Responsive design
- Modern UI with appealing visual style

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click the "Spin Roulette" button to start the wheel
3. Watch as the ball spins and bounces according to physics
4. Use the "Reset" button to start over

## Technical Details

The game is built using:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript for game logic and physics
- CSS for styling and layout

The physics simulation includes:
- Rotational physics for the wheel
- Gravity effects on the ball
- Bounce mechanics
- Friction for natural deceleration

## Browser Compatibility

The game works best in modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas and modern JavaScript features.
